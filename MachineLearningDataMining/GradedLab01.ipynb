Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale however was a talented amateur who committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationship with the Prince to the press. As a consequence, she soon found herself excluded from the royal circle. Following this exclusion her mental fragility led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and she died aged 49 in unusual circumstances in 1997, only months after Diana. With exclusive and previously unseen interviews with Dale herself and heartfelt contributions from friends and journalists who knew her well including Oscar-nominated actress Sarah Miles.

Forbidden Archeology takes on one of the most fundamental components of the modern scientific world view, and invites us to take a courageous first step towards a new perspective. Michael Cremo is on the cutting edge of science and cultural issues. In the course of a few months' time, he might be found on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in India, appearing on a national television show, lecturing at a mainstream science conference, or speaking to an alternative science gathering. In this comprehensive, multi DVD presentation, he crosses disciplinary and cultural boundaries and presents a compelling case for negotiating a new consensus on the nature of reality.

Patrick, an American card shark and dealer of stolen artifacts, has been 'comfortably numb' in Cambodia for years, when he encounters Holly, a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl, in the K11 red light village. The girl has been sold by her impoverished family and smuggled across the border to work as a prostitute. Holly's virginity makes her a lucrative prize, and when she is sold to a child trafficker, Patrick embarks on a frantic search through both the beautiful and sordid faces of the country, in an attempt to bring her to safety. Harsh, yet poetic, this feature forms part of the 'K-11' Project, dedicated to raising awareness of the epidemic of child trafficking and the sex slavery trade through several film projects. The film's producers endured substantial hardships in order to be able to shoot in Cambodia and have also founded the RedLight Children Campaign, which is a worldwide grassroots initiative generating conscious concern and inspiring immediate action against child sexploitation.</td>\n",

At the age of 17, Griselda Blanco, made her way to the U.S. with a fake passport with her first husband Carlos. Living in Queens with her three sons, Griselda became enticed by the money the drug world offered, and quickly became embroiled with local drug runners. Griselda masterminded the use of beautiful women, the elderly and children as the mules and created false-bottom suitcases to smuggle cocaine from Colombia. With money rolling in, her sons abandoned school and entered the family business instead.</td>\n",

However, his dreams are shattered when he is accused of a triple murder, and is convicted to three natural-life terms. Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography, the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an African-American boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration. However, what Hurricane and his friends learn is that this fight puts them against a racist establishment that profited from this travesty and have no intention of seeing it reversed.  \n",

For a period in the 1970s Kanga (Lady Tryon), and Camilla Parker Bowles were deadly rivals for the Prince's affections. Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale however was a talented amateur who committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationship with the Prince to the press. As a consequence, she soon found herself excluded from the royal circle. Following this exclusion her mental fragility led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and she died aged 49 in unusual circumstances in 1997, only months after Diana.

He even keeps dragging Gus away from his pharmaceutical firm's team building weekend to assist. The victim was involved in a haphazard love affair and when she is found, attacked and unconscious, Shawn disagrees with the police theory on the attack.  \n",

Trueba drapes walls with single colors - red for Jerry González and the Fort Apache band, white for Tito Puente; his camera is close to faces, instruments, hands, and feet; bands' colors contrast with walls or their leader's clothes. Chucho Valdés does a pyrotechnic solo then joins his aged father Bebo for a subdued duet. Puntilla Ríos takes us to Africa, Chano Domínguez to a marriage of jazz and Flamenco, and Eliane Elias, her shoe-less foot on the pedal, to gorgeous and muscular elegance.

       "12  Over the past two centuries researchers have found bones and artifacts showing that people like us existed on earth millions of years ago. But the scientific establishment has ignored these remarkable facts because they contradict the dominant views of human origins and antiquity. Michael Cremo challenges us to rethink our understanding of human origins, identity, and destiny. Forbidden Archeology takes on one of the most fundamental components of the modern scientific world view, and invites us to take a courageous first step towards a new perspective. Michael Cremo is on the cutting edge of science and cultural issues. In the course of a few months' time, he might be found on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in India, appearing on a national television show, lecturing at a mainstream science conference, or speaking to an alternative science gathering. In this comprehensive, multi DVD presentation, he crosses disciplinary and cultural boundaries and presents a compelling case for negotiating a new consensus on the nature of reality. Michael Cremo is a member of the World Archeological Congress and the European Association of Archaeologists as well as an associate member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, specializing in the history and philosophy of science.

Patrick, an American card shark and dealer of stolen artifacts, has been 'comfortably numb' in Cambodia for years, when he encounters Holly, a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl, in the K11 red light village. The girl has been sold by her impoverished family and smuggled across the border to work as a prostitute. Holly's virginity makes her a lucrative prize, and when she is sold to a child trafficker, Patrick embarks on a frantic search through both the beautiful and sordid faces of the country, in an attempt to bring her to safety. Harsh, yet poetic, this feature forms part of the 'K-11' Project, dedicated to raising awareness of the epidemic of child trafficking and the sex slavery trade through several film projects. The film's producers endured substantial hardships in order to be able to shoot in Cambodia and have also founded the RedLight Children Campaign, which is a worldwide grassroots initiative generating conscious concern and inspiring immediate action against child sexploitation.  \n",

Born in the middle of 1970-s, they were raised on soviet cartoons and at the time of empty shelves in the shops. Almost on the eve when our country re-established its independence they founded the group and named it Brainstorm. For the first time the group reveals their life-story and tells about experienced twists and turns, about East and West. The film also follows their work on their latest album in Berlin and reveals unique personal archive footage. This film is the story about Latvia's and Brainstorm's way for 25 years. The film is about the spirit of stubbornness and disobedience, about perseverance and capability to fall and rise again.  \n",

Bounty hunter John Ruth and his fugitive captive Daisy Domergue race towards the town of Red Rock, where Ruth will bring Daisy to justice. Along the road, they encounter Major Marquis Warren (an infamous bounty hunter) and Chris Mannix (a man who claims to be Red Rock's new sheriff). Lost in a blizzard, the bunch seeks refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. When they arrive they are greeted by unfamiliar faces: Bob, who claims to be taking care of the place while Minnie is gone; Oswaldo Mobray, the hangman of Red Rock; Joe Gage, a cow puncher; and confederate general Sanford Smithers. As the storm overtakes the mountainside, the eight travelers come to learn that they might not make it to Red Rock after all...  \n",

As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.  \n",

He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.  \n",

Six months later, Cosby is a multi-millionaire, Blanco's lover, and the head of her $40 million a year cocaine business. Also known as \"The Black Widow\" for her propensity to permanently dispose of her men when she's done with them, Blanco will stop at nothing to ensure that Charles is faithful to her. Cosby soon learns that he's in way over his head.  "

Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business.

But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it.

This changes when an African-American boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration.

For a period in the 1970s Kanga (Lady Tryon), and Camilla Parker Bowles were deadly rivals for the Prince's affections. Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale however was a talented amateur who committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationship with the Prince to the press. As a consequence, she soon found herself excluded from the royal circle. Following this exclusion her mental fragility led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and she died aged 49 in unusual circumstances in 1997, only months after Diana. With exclusive and previously unseen interviews with Dale herself and heartfelt contributions from friends and journalists who knew her well including Oscar-nominated actress Sarah Miles. Prince Charles' Other Mistress will shed new light on, and add a new name to, the familiar landscape of the relationship between Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles and Diana, Princess of Wales.</td>\n",

Forbidden Archeology takes on one of the most fundamental components of the modern scientific world view, and invites us to take a courageous first step towards a new perspective. Michael Cremo is on the cutting edge of science and cultural issues. In the course of a few months' time, he might be found on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in India, appearing on a national television show, lecturing at a mainstream science conference, or speaking to an alternative science gathering. In this comprehensive, multi DVD presentation, he crosses disciplinary and cultural boundaries and presents a compelling case for negotiating a new consensus on the nature of reality.

However, his dreams are shattered when he is accused of a triple murder, and is convicted to three natural-life terms. Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography, the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an African-American boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration. However, what Hurricane and his friends learn is that this fight puts them against a racist establishment that profited from this travesty and have no intention of seeing it reversed.  \n",

For a period in the 1970s Kanga (Lady Tryon), and Camilla Parker Bowles were deadly rivals for the Prince's affections. Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale however was a talented amateur who committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationship with the Prince to the press. As a consequence, she soon found herself excluded from the royal circle. Following this exclusion her mental fragility led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and she died aged 49 in unusual circumstances in 1997, only months after Diana.

He even keeps dragging Gus away from his pharmaceutical firm's team building weekend to assist. The victim was involved in a haphazard love affair and when she is found, attacked and unconscious, Shawn disagrees with the police theory on the attack.  \n",

       "12  Over the past two centuries researchers have found bones and artifacts showing that people like us existed on earth millions of years ago. But the scientific establishment has ignored these remarkable facts because they contradict the dominant views of human origins and antiquity. Michael Cremo challenges us to rethink our understanding of human origins, identity, and destiny. Forbidden Archeology takes on one of the most fundamental components of the modern scientific world view, and invites us to take a courageous first step towards a new perspective. Michael Cremo is on the cutting edge of science and cultural issues. In the course of a few months' time, he might be found on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in India, appearing on a national television show, lecturing at a mainstream science conference, or speaking to an alternative science gathering. In this comprehensive, multi DVD presentation, he crosses disciplinary and cultural boundaries and presents a compelling case for negotiating a new consensus on the nature of reality. Michael Cremo is a member of the World Archeological Congress and the European Association of Archaeologists as well as an associate member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, specializing in the history and philosophy of science.

Will Merlin die victim to his own lusts and desires, giving to a beautiful woman the very secrets she needs to destroy him?

At the age of 17, Griselda Blanco, made her way to the U.S. with a fake passport with her first husband Carlos. Living in Queens with her three sons, Griselda became enticed by the money the drug world offered, and quickly became embroiled with local drug runners. Griselda masterminded the use of beautiful women, the elderly and children as the mules and created false-bottom suitcases to smuggle cocaine from Colombia. With money rolling in, her sons abandoned school and entered the family business instead.  \n",

Six months later, Cosby is a multi-millionaire, Blanco's lover, and the head of her $40 million a year cocaine business. Also known as \"The Black Widow\" for her propensity to permanently dispose of her men when she's done with them, Blanco will stop at nothing to ensure that Charles is faithful to her. Cosby soon learns that he's in way over his head.  "

The only stolen effects are found dumped in the ocean; Dr. Ward tells Mark about their affair without accusing Jill. When Mark finds a contact lens, he realizes Ward is a suspect too, or probably the pair of them did it together- at her trial, they seem to be playing an elaborate game, but how can the Sloanes disprove it or is it too late already?  \n",

When she gets caught by the agents Ray Nicolet and Mark Dargus with ten thousand dollars and cocaine in her purse, they propose a deal to her to help them to arrest Ordell in exchange of her freedom. Meanwhile Ordell asks the 56-year-old Max Cherry, who runs a bail bond business, to release Jackie Brown with the intention of eliminating her. Jackie suspects of Ordell's intention and plots a complicated confidence game with Max to steal half a million dollars from Ordell.  \n",

Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography, the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an African-American boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration.

Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale however was a talented amateur who committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationship with the Prince to the press. As a consequence, she soon found herself excluded from the royal circle. Following this exclusion her mental fragility led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and she died aged 49 in unusual circumstances in 1997, only months after Diana. With exclusive and previously unseen interviews with Dale herself and heartfelt contributions from friends and journalists who knew her well including Oscar-nominated actress Sarah Miles.

Michael Cremo challenges us to rethink our understanding of human origins, identity, and destiny. Forbidden Archeology takes on one of the most fundamental components of the modern scientific world view, and invites us to take a courageous first step towards a new perspective. Michael Cremo is on the cutting edge of science and cultural issues. In the course of a few months' time, he might be found on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in India, appearing on a national television show, lecturing at a mainstream science conference, or speaking to an alternative science gathering. In this comprehensive, multi DVD presentation, he crosses disciplinary and cultural boundaries and presents a compelling case for negotiating a new consensus on the nature of reality.

The girl has been sold by her impoverished family and smuggled across the border to work as a prostitute. Holly's virginity makes her a lucrative prize, and when she is sold to a child trafficker, Patrick embarks on a frantic search through both the beautiful and sordid faces of the country, in an attempt to bring her to safety. Harsh, yet poetic, this feature forms part of the 'K-11' Project, dedicated to raising awareness of the epidemic of child trafficking and the sex slavery trade through several film projects. The film's producers endured substantial hardships in order to be able to shoot in Cambodia and have also founded the RedLight Children Campaign, which is a worldwide grassroots initiative generating conscious concern and inspiring immediate action against child sexploitation.</td>\n",

However, his dreams are shattered when he is accused of a triple murder, and is convicted to three natural-life terms. Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography, the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an African-American boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration. However, what Hurricane and his friends learn is that this fight puts them against a racist establishment that profited from this travesty and have no intention of seeing it reversed.   \n",

Czech and Slovak pilots flee to England, joining the RAF. After the war, back home, they are put in labor camps, suspected of anti-Communist ideas. This film cuts between a post-war camp where Franta is a prisoner and England during the war, where Franta is like a big brother to Karel, a very young pilot. On maneuvers, Karel crash lands by the rural home of Susan, an English woman whose husband is MIA. She spends one night with Karel, and he thinks he's found the love of his life. It's complicated by Susan's attraction to Franta. How will the three handle innocence, Eros, friendship, and the heat of battle? When war ends, what then?   \n",

For a period in the 1970s Kanga (Lady Tryon), and Camilla Parker Bowles were deadly rivals for the Prince's affections. Camilla was the consummate insider who knew how to play the royal game, Dale however was a talented amateur who committed the cardinal sin of talking about her relationship with the Prince to the press. As a consequence, she soon found herself excluded from the royal circle. Following this exclusion her mental fragility led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act and she died aged 49 in unusual circumstances in 1997, only months after Diana. With exclusive and previously unseen interviews with Dale herself and heartfelt contributions from friends and journalists who knew her well including Oscar-nominated actress Sarah Miles. Prince Charles' Other Mistress will shed new light on, and add a new name to, the familiar landscape of the relationship between Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles and Diana, Princess of Wales.   \n",

       "12  Over the past two centuries researchers have found bones and artifacts showing that people like us existed on earth millions of years ago. But the scientific establishment has ignored these remarkable facts because they contradict the dominant views of human origins and antiquity. Michael Cremo challenges us to rethink our understanding of human origins, identity, and destiny. Forbidden Archeology takes on one of the most fundamental components of the modern scientific world view, and invites us to take a courageous first step towards a new perspective. Michael Cremo is on the cutting edge of science and cultural issues. In the course of a few months' time, he might be found on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in India, appearing on a national television show, lecturing at a mainstream science conference, or speaking to an alternative science gathering. In this comprehensive, multi DVD presentation, he crosses disciplinary and cultural boundaries and presents a compelling case for negotiating a new consensus on the nature of reality. Michael Cremo is a member of the World Archeological Congress and the European Association of Archaeologists as well as an associate member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, specializing in the history and philosophy of science.

It's not something you could complain about. Then he's caught in the middle of an affair involving politics, corruption, and the fate of thousands of people. But that's not the real danger. A beautiful young woman comes into his life - girlfriend of his dead stepson. She has reasons of her own for wanting his secrets, and Merlin is subjected to all her erotic charm as she tries to learn his powers. Will the prophecy will be fulfilled once again? Will Merlin die victim to his own lusts and desires, giving to a beautiful woman the very secrets she needs to destroy him? Enchantress is a dark and compelling story of lust, desire, corruption and betrayal.   \n",

Patrick, an American card shark and dealer of stolen artifacts, has been 'comfortably numb' in Cambodia for years, when he encounters Holly, a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl, in the K11 red light village. The girl has been sold by her impoverished family and smuggled across the border to work as a prostitute. Holly's virginity makes her a lucrative prize, and when she is sold to a child trafficker, Patrick embarks on a frantic search through both the beautiful and sordid faces of the country, in an attempt to bring her to safety. Harsh, yet poetic, this feature forms part of the 'K-11' Project, dedicated to raising awareness of the epidemic of child trafficking and the sex slavery trade through several film projects. The film's producers endured substantial hardships in order to be able to shoot in Cambodia and have also founded the RedLight Children Campaign, which is a worldwide grassroots initiative generating conscious concern and inspiring immediate action against child sexploitation.   \n",

Almost on the eve when our country re-established its independence they founded the group and named it Brainstorm. For the first time the group reveals their life-story and tells about experienced twists and turns, about East and West. The film also follows their work on their latest album in Berlin and reveals unique personal archive footage. This film is the story about Latvia's and Brainstorm's way for 25 years. The film is about the spirit of stubbornness and disobedience, about perseverance and capability to fall and rise again.   \n",

Bounty hunter John Ruth and his fugitive captive Daisy Domergue race towards the town of Red Rock, where Ruth will bring Daisy to justice. Along the road, they encounter Major Marquis Warren (an infamous bounty hunter) and Chris Mannix (a man who claims to be Red Rock's new sheriff). Lost in a blizzard, the bunch seeks refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. When they arrive they are greeted by unfamiliar faces: Bob, who claims to be taking care of the place while Minnie is gone; Oswaldo Mobray, the hangman of Red Rock; Joe Gage, a cow puncher; and confederate general Sanford Smithers. As the storm overtakes the mountainside, the eight travelers come to learn that they might not make it to Red Rock after all...   \n",

As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.   \n",

He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.   \n",

At the age of 17, Griselda Blanco, made her way to the U.S. with a fake passport with her first husband Carlos. Living in Queens with her three sons, Griselda became enticed by the money the drug world offered, and quickly became embroiled with local drug runners. Griselda masterminded the use of beautiful women, the elderly and children as the mules and created false-bottom suitcases to smuggle cocaine from Colombia. With money rolling in, her sons abandoned school and entered the family business instead.   \n",

Six months later, Cosby is a multi-millionaire, Blanco's lover, and the head of her $40 million a year cocaine business. Also known as \"The Black Widow\" for her propensity to permanently dispose of her men when she's done with them, Blanco will stop at nothing to ensure that Charles is faithful to her. Cosby soon learns that he's in way over his head.   \n",
